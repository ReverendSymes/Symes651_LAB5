The mapping application located in index.html is designed to present a map centred on Calgary AB. In the bottom left hand corner of the map there is a polyline edit bar that allows the user to draw and display polylines. After being created the polyline can be simplified using Turf.js using the supplied button. If the user would like to get rid of everything and reload the map they may click the appropriate button aswell.
